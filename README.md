# Wave–vortex decomposition
This simple code applies the Helmholtz and wave-vortex decompositions developed in [Bühler et al. (JFM, 2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2014.488) to given velocity and buoyancy wavenumber spectra. A Python (`wv-dec.py`) and a MATLAB (`wv.dec.m`) version of the code is provided. Both a hydrostatic and a nonhydrostatic version of the wave–vortex decomposition is given. If vertical velocity spectra are available, the nonhydrostatic version can be used, as in the example that is supplied with this code. Please refer to the Bühler et al. paper for a discussion of the assumptions going into the decomposition.
